I am Daniel McCrevan, a recent graduate of RPI's computer science department. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Software Systems concentration),
and a minor in Economics.

I am particularly interested in areas of open source, systems programming, cloud-native, and developer productivity. I am also into compilers, type theory,
and static analysis.

I am currently attending the Fall batch of the [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/). If you want to become a better programmer you should check it out!

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring the city, working out, and watching the Celtics, Red Sox, and Patriots. I am also trying to get back into fishing.
