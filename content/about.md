I am Daniel McCrevan, a recent graduate of RPI's computer science department. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Software Systems concentration),
and a minor in Economics.

I am particularly interested in areas of open source, systems programming, cloud-native, and developer productivity. I am also into compilers, type theory,
and static analysis.

I am currently working on [Netting](https://github.com/Netting-Mesh/netting), a simplified, plug & play service mesh entirely written in Rust. I am starting this
blog to post my random ramblings about my development stories with this.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exploring the city, working out, and watching the Celtics, Red Sox, and Patriots. I am also trying to get back into fishing.
