This is the first time in 2020 where I felt like time has escaped me.

## Recurse center reflection

Twelve weeks ago, I started the Fall 1 batch at the [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/). I didn't know what to expect other
than that I will have a structure around this free time I didn't expect to have. In the first few days, I thought I was going
to be primarily working on my priority executor project, writing a Linux kernel module, and possibly diving deeper into lower level development. Even
though I would've been perfectly happy doing all of this, I didn't spend any of my time doing any of this. These past twelve weeks
have been full of functional programming (Haskell) and compilers (LLVM). A full list of my accomplishments/things I worked on are below:

 * Completed [CIS 194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/)
 * Finished part of [fp-course](https://github.com/bitemyapp/fp-course)
 * Read chapters 1-8 of [Engineering a compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper-ebook-dp-B00J5AS70G/dp/B00J5AS70G/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1597246799)
 * Read through [Stephen Diehl's tutorial](https://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/) on writing a compiler in Haskell & began to fix up some modules
 * Learned more about LLVM & currently in the process of submitting a bug fix to the upstream
 * Wrote a [SQL parser](https://github.com/tkuriyama/toydb) with a recurse friend (Taro) for a toy database project
 * Wrote an implementation of a hashmap in C
 * Created a proof of concept for my priority executor project
 * Wrote a barebones backtesting infrastructure in Haskell


I couldn't imagine thinking that I would accomplish all of this when I first began, but I am so happy with the outcome of this. I 
really felt like I found a passion of mine that I've been looking for, and I can't wait to see where this brings me. Even though this is the end of
my batch at recurse, I now know what it means to never graduate!

A special thanks to all of the faculty at recurse and all of my FP & compiler friends that I met along the way during recurse!

## What is next?

Well, I am super grateful and fortunate to have had a job lined up before joining recurse so I could primarily focus on learning during my time there.
I am joining Wayfair as a software engineer on November 9th. I'll be doing a wide range of full-stack engineering in my role. I am super excited about what
this experience will be like.

Until next time,
