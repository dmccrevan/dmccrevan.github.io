It is starting to feel like Fall here in New England. I have officially begun to have to wait for my car to heat up in the morning before going to the gym. That
is typically a good indicator of when the warm weather has begun to pass. 

Last week I didn't achieve everything I wanted to, but it was a very productive week. The reason behind the lack of progress was some unexpected speed bumps when setting up the PLFA & Compiler
environments. Other than that though, it felt like a typical week. I was able to continue progress on the FP Course, completed the first chapter of PLFA (Agda is strange), worked
on my elixir app, started a systems programming exercise, and finally scoped out the compiler study group course of action. The new systems programming exercise is a collection of
[exercises](https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog17s/exercises.html). I am going to start with the hash map implementation since this is the one that seems most challenging to me.

For this upcoming week, I am taking a different approach to organizing my day & tasks and I have a few goals I want to achieve. The new way of organizing my day is with a simple notebook & pen
rather than calcurse. I don't have a reason for doing this other than I have always used some notebook as a productivity tool during most of my academic career. I have one for daily tasks,
one for notes, and one for tracking my workout sessions. 

The goals I have for this upcoming week are the following:

### Health & Fitness goals
* Workout everyday
* Fast at least 16 hours a day
* Limit my social media screen time to one hour a day

### Recurse goals
* Work consistently from 9 AM-5 PM each day.
* Read one blog post per day
* Finish my elixir app
* Make progress on each study group's material

### Other
* Declutter my work area (even though it's already pretty minimal)
* Set up my raspberry pi as a backup server

Until next time,
