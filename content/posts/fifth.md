Wow, three weeks of Recurse already! This week was the first week where I felt like I was in a groove and solidified what I want to be working on. I have
essentially narrowed my work down to attending both the compiler & functional programming study groups, working on my priority executor project, and planning
on pairing with a peer to work through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (except we'll be translating the code in Haskell rather than
Java). 

This week I was able to accomplish progress on all of my goals. I was able to add the binary heap data structure to my priority executor project. It now has all of the base
functionality I want for it, next up for it is to clean up the codebase & learn how to structure a library idiomatically in Rust. This week was also a very eye-opening week within
my Haskell learning, in particular today. In our group, we watched a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQt1NAHYC0) on functional programming design patterns. Scott Wlaschin,
the one giving the talk, clearly explained partial applications and monads in a way that I feel like I have a much better understanding of how to use them when programming.

Hoping that the momentum keeps up and I accomplish more by next week!
