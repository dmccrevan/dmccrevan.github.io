Today was my *first* day of the full Fall 1 2020 batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Technically, I started on Monday for orientation, but I was
away camping for the past few days, so I really started today. I am so grateful to have this opportunity since it will end right before I start my job at Wayfair, as well as being able to pursue passion projects & learning with a great community in these next twelve weeks. 

The area I am interested in learning more about is Rust (asynchronous runtimes in particular), compilers, systems programming, and the Linux kernel. A few project ideas I
have come up with are:

   * An asynchronous runtime (or maybe just an executor)
   * A tiny C compiler
   * A kernel module

So far, I have joined the morning check-ins meeting and a compiler study group. In the compiler study group, I want to collaborate to try to work on open-source compiler projects as well
as go through the book we agreed to read: [Engineering a compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper-ebook-dp-B00J5AS70G/dp/B00J5AS70G/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1597246799).

Even though I have a few project ideas listed above, my end goal of the batch is to gain a deeper understanding of the areas I'm interested in. Even if this means I don't finish any of my projects, or I switch from working on my own project to open-source ones, I am open to it as long as I feel like I'm learning more each day.

Excited to see what these next twelve weeks bring!
