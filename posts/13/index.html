    <p>This is the first time in 2020 where I felt like time has escaped me.</p>
<h2 id="recurse-center-reflection">Recurse center reflection</h2>
<p>Twelve weeks ago, I started the Fall 1 batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a>. I didn't know what to expect other
than that I will have a structure around this free time I didn't expect to have. In the first few days, I thought I was going
to be primarily working on my priority executor project, writing a Linux kernel module, and possibly diving deeper into lower level development. Even
though I would've been perfectly happy doing all of this, I didn't spend any of my time doing any of this. These past twelve weeks
have been full of functional programming (Haskell) and compilers (LLVM). A full list of my accomplishments/things I worked on are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/fall16/">CIS 194</a></li>
<li>Finished part of <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/fp-course">fp-course</a></li>
<li>Read chapters 1-8 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper-ebook-dp-B00J5AS70G/dp/B00J5AS70G/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1597246799">Engineering a compiler</a></li>
<li>Read through <a href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/">Stephen Diehl's tutorial</a> on writing a compiler in Haskell &amp; began to fix up some modules</li>
<li>Learned more about LLVM &amp; currently in the process of submitting a bug fix to the upstream</li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tkuriyama/toydb">SQL parser</a> with a recurse friend (Taro) for a toy database project</li>
<li>Wrote an implementation of a hashmap in C</li>
<li>Created a proof of concept for my priority executor project</li>
<li>Wrote a barebones backtesting infrastructure in Haskell</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn't imagine thinking that I would accomplish all of this when I first began, but I am so happy with the outcome of this. I 
really felt like I found a passion of mine that I've been looking for, and I can't wait to see where this brings me. Even though this is the end of
my batch at recurse, I now know what it means to never graduate!</p>
<p>A special thanks to all of the faculty at recurse and all of my FP &amp; compiler friends that I met along the way during recurse!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>Well, I am super grateful and fortunate to have had a job lined up before joining recurse so I could primarily focus on learning during my time there.
I am joining Wayfair as a software engineer on November 9th. I'll be doing a wide range of full-stack engineering in my role. I am super excited about what
this experience will be like.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>~ Dan</p>
