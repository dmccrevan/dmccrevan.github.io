    <p>It is starting to feel like Fall here in New England. I have officially begun to have to wait for my car to heat up in the morning before going to the gym. That
is typically a good indicator of when the warm weather has begun to pass. </p>
<p>Last week I didn't achieve everything I wanted to, but it was a very productive week. The reason behind the lack of progress was some unexpected speed bumps when setting up the PLFA &amp; Compiler
environments. Other than that though, it felt like a typical week. I was able to continue progress on the FP Course, completed the first chapter of PLFA (Agda is strange), worked
on my elixir app, started a systems programming exercise, and finally scoped out the compiler study group course of action. The new systems programming exercise is a collection of
<a href="https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog17s/exercises.html">exercises</a>. I am going to start with the hash map implementation since this is the one that seems most challenging to me.</p>
<p>For this upcoming week, I am taking a different approach to organizing my day &amp; tasks and I have a few goals I want to achieve. The new way of organizing my day is with a simple notebook &amp; pen
rather than calcurse. I don't have a reason for doing this other than I have always used some notebook as a productivity tool during most of my academic career. I have one for daily tasks,
one for notes, and one for tracking my workout sessions. </p>
<p>The goals I have for this upcoming week are the following:</p>
<h3 id="health-fitness-goals">Health &amp; Fitness goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Workout everyday</li>
<li>Fast at least 16 hours a day</li>
<li>Limit my social media screen time to one hour a day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recurse-goals">Recurse goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work consistently from 9 AM-5 PM each day.</li>
<li>Read one blog post per day</li>
<li>Finish my elixir app</li>
<li>Make progress on each study group's material</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<ul>
<li>Declutter my work area (even though it's already pretty minimal)</li>
<li>Set up my raspberry pi as a backup server</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>~ Dan</p>
