    <p>Wow, three weeks of Recurse already! This week was the first week where I felt like I was in a groove and solidified what I want to be working on. I have
essentially narrowed my work down to attending both the compiler &amp; functional programming study groups, working on my priority executor project, and planning
on pairing with a peer to work through <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> (except we'll be translating the code in Haskell rather than
Java). </p>
<p>This week I was able to accomplish progress on all of my goals. I was able to add the binary heap data structure to my priority executor project. It now has all of the base
functionality I want for it, next up for it is to clean up the codebase &amp; learn how to structure a library idiomatically in Rust. This week was also a very eye-opening week within
my Haskell learning, in particular today. In our group, we watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQt1NAHYC0">lecture</a> on functional programming design patterns. Scott Wlaschin,
the one giving the talk, clearly explained partial applications and monads in a way that I feel like I have a much better understanding of how to use them when programming.</p>
<p>Hoping that the momentum keeps up and I accomplish more by next week!</p>
<p>~ Dan</p>
