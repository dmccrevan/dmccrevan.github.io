    <p>It is a weird feeling that next week is the end of September, it almost feels like I never realized it was even September. That may be due to this being
my first year out of schooling along with 2020 being a strange year altogether.</p>
<p>Last week was a refreshing context switch. I joined a new group, tried out new technology, started a new FP course, and changed the structure of the compiler reading
group. The new group I joined is the Programming Languages &amp; Type Theory Study Group. We are currently deciding what book we are going to read, but the suggested
ones so far all seem interesting. </p>
<p>In regards to the functional programming study group, we hit a cool milestone by finishing by CIS 194. This course was a fantastic
introduction to pure functional programming with Haskell. We are now moving on to the <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/fp-course">FP Course</a> which is the suggested
follow-up course to CIS 194. It seems to be more hands-on which is going to be helpful for myself.</p>
<p>For the compiler study group, we are switching from reading Engineering a compiler to following a guide to build some sort of compiler/interpreter. Next week we will be
determining what exactly we are going to do, but we have collectively agreed on writing our project in Haskell. This is a nice switch up for the group since we were about
400 pages into the book, and it seemed like it was a good time to take a more hands-on approach. </p>
<p>This coming week will be fun since it's going to be the first real week of all of the new curriculum I am going to be following, and for a side thing I am trying out a new
editing environment, <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a>. </p>
<p>Until next time,
~ Dan</p>
