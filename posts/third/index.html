    <p>Today was my <em>first</em> day of the full Fall 1 2020 batch at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. Technically, I started on Monday for orientation, but I was
away camping for the past few days, so I really started today. I am so grateful to have this opportunity since it will end right before I start my job at Wayfair, as well as being able to pursue passion projects &amp; learning with a great community in these next twelve weeks. </p>
<p>The area I am interested in learning more about is Rust (asynchronous runtimes in particular), compilers, systems programming, and the Linux kernel. A few project ideas I
have come up with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An asynchronous runtime (or maybe just an executor)</li>
<li>A tiny C compiler</li>
<li>A kernel module</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I have joined the morning check-ins meeting and a compiler study group. In the compiler study group, I want to collaborate to try to work on open-source compiler projects as well
as go through the book we agreed to read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper-ebook-dp-B00J5AS70G/dp/B00J5AS70G/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1597246799">Engineering a compiler</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I have a few project ideas listed above, my end goal of the batch is to gain a deeper understanding of the areas I'm interested in. Even if this means I don't finish any of my projects, or I switch from working on my own project to open-source ones, I am open to it as long as I feel like I'm learning more each day.</p>
<p>Excited to see what these next twelve weeks bring!</p>
<p>~ Dan</p>
